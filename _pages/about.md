I am an assistant professor within the <a href="http://psychosystems.org/" target="blank">psychosystems</a> group, at the Psychological Methods department of the University of Amsterdam (UvA). 

My research focuses on the complex interplay between insomnia and depression -- at the biological, psychological, and social level. The aim to integrate these different levels comes from combining my educational background in psychological methods (learning about psychopathology networks) with my PhD at the Netherlands Insitute for Neuroscience (focusing on insomnia and depression) and work I did during the COVID-19 crisis (investigating social contact networks along which behaviour can spread). The common denominator is the use of network analyses and complexity science, which I now use to link these levels and shed light on the dynamic interplay between insomnia and depression (see selected publications below).

My <a href="https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/changing-perspectives-on-insomnia-and-depression-from-symptoms-to" target="blank">dissertation</a> on *Changing perspectives on insomnia and depression: From symptoms to system* (cum laude) was awarded the <a href="https://www.nswo.nl/prijsuitreikingen-najaarsymposium-nswo-2020/" target="blank">Hilbert Kamphuisen Award</a> for best dissertation 2019-2020 and was mentioned in the <a href="https://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/ontstaan-psychiatrische-aandoeningen-door-alledaagse-klachten-die-zich-opstapelen~b82caff2/" target="blank">Volkskrant</a> as a demonstration of how direct interactions among symptoms can cause psychopathological disorders to get intertwined. 

During COVID-19, I co-founded the interdisciplinary platform <a href="https://scienceversuscorona.com/" target="blank">Science versus Corona</a>, including a data consultancy desk, to unite scientistis across disciplines to understand and fight the coronavirus. I currently <a href="https://sobedsc.wordpress.com/research/">lead the research</a> we are doing on behavioural solutions to COVID-19 and am involved in the <a href="https://www.ampl-psych.com/projects/minds-for-mobile-agents/" target="blank">M4MA lab</a> that was initiated from this work to model pedestrain behaviour.  

I am a member of the <a href="https://dsc.uva.nl/people/affiliate-members/affiliate-members.html" target="blank">Data Science Centre</a> at the UvA, who funded part of my postdoc within the <a href="https://sobedsc.wordpress.com/team/" target="blank">Social and Behavioral Data Science Centre</a>. In addition I received a personal research grant from the BIAL Foundation to investigate the cross-modal link between sleep and mood.
