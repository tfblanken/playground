Back in 2016 I read a great paper by Santo Fortunato on community detection in graphs [1]. Especially the following quote sparked my attention:

<blockquote>
	“Identifying modules and their boundaries allows for a classification of vertices, according to their structural position in the modules. So, vertices with a central position in their clusters, i.e. sharing a large number of edges with the other group partners, may have an important function of control and stability within the group; vertices lying at the boundaries between modules play an important role of mediation and lead the relationships and exchanges between different communities.” (p. 3)
</blockquote>


At the time, I was working together with Marie Deserno and Jonas Dalege on a large "landscape of psychopathology". The possibility to look for overlapping communities wihtin this landscape got us all excited, and finally resulted in a publication which is described in <a href="https://tfblanken.github.io/2018/04/06/stabilizing-communicating-symptoms.html" target="blank">this</a> blogpost. 

Key to this project was the identification of *overlapping* communities. One algorithm that is developed to do so is the program <a href="http://www.cfinder.org/" target="blank">CFinder</a>, developed by Tamás Vicsek and colleagues from Eötvös University in Budapest. During the analyses we became fans of CFinder and sometimes daydreamed about going to Budapest to meet the geniuses behind the program, talk about our project, and discuss possiblities for future projects. I don't know how or when precisely, but over time this daydreaming evolved into an actual email and eventually our trip to Budapest in November 2018.
