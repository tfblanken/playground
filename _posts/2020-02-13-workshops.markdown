description: workshops on networks in psychology in Trondheim and Belfast
---

Over the last couple of months I co-organised two workshops on networks in psychology.

The first workshop took place on December 17 and 18 2019 in Trondheim and was organised together with <a href="http://gabylunansky.com/" target="blank">Gaby Lunansky</a>. In this workshop we focused on conducting network analyses using R, see schedule below. We are both happy to share our materials!

The second workshop was taught together with Marie Deserno in Belfast, February 13-14 of this year. In addition to applying network analyses in R, we also discussed the theoretical foundations underlying network analyses, and followed up with more advanced topics like time series analyses:
