Glamour asked me to contribute to an article on how to sleep better. Although I'm no sleep therapist, and my research does not directly result in tips and tricks, it does give an important message that they were very happy to share: sleep - and insomnia - goes well beyond sleep itself. We found that the context in which sleep problems are developed and maintained may be very important to our understanding and treatment of insomnia. I was happy to share my thoughts on insomnia and honoured to be introduced by glamour as a powerful woman!
