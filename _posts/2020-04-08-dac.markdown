On March 25th we launched <a href="https://dataversuscorona.com/" target="blank">Data scientists Against Corona</a> (DAC), a platform to unite data scientists from all over the world to help society in the battle against corona. 

Today, two weeks after we launched, we have over 90 data scientists and the first four projects are well underway. It is great to see so many people coming together, wanting to help each other and society.
