description: large-scale social distancing study in the Smart Distance Lab
---

In March we (<a href="https://twitter.com/CharlotteCTanis" target="blank">Charlotte Tanis</a>, <a href="https://fabiandablander.com/" target="blank">Fabian Dablander</a>, <a href="https://dennyborsboom.com/" target="blank">Denny Borsboom</a>) launched Data versus Corona, a platform to unite data scientists from all over the world to offer their assistance in COVID-19 research. However, we soon realized that data analysis alone was not going to get us out of the crisis. Therefore, in April, we launched the platform <a href="https://strategiesversuscorona.com/en/" target="blank">Strategies versus Corona</a>, to crowdsource, model, and evaluate possible exit strategies through an Open Science and Citizen Science based initiative. Both platforms were united in <a href="https://scienceversuscorona.com/" target="blank">Science versus Corona</a>, with the ultimate goal to bring together people, ideas, and knowledge trying to move out of this crisis. Among other things, the website contains <a href="https://scienceversuscorona.com/blog/" target="blank">blog posts</a> from a.o. experts in the field, and contains apps that allow you to explore the virous spread around the world and the effect of <a href="https://scienceversuscorona.shinyapps.io/covid-forecast/" target="blank">various interventions</a>. Check it out! Also, Anouk Bercht, journalist of Dutch magazine 'De Psycholoog', was part of our platform for one week and wrote this very nice <a href="https://www.tijdschriftdepsycholoog.nl/artikelen/project-exit-lockdown/" target="blank">report</a> about it. 

But that was then, in March/ April, and times are moving fast. Last weekend, together with Charlotte, Denny, and a great team of volunteers we stepped away from our computers and conducted a _very_ large scale behavioral experiment to investigate social distancing measures, collecting over 197K datapoints!

In the summer, we stumbled upon and started a collaboration with the <a href="https://smartdistancelab.nl/" target="blank">Smart Distance Lab</a> (SDL). SDL organised an art fair in Amsterdam Noord, and offered an opportunity for companies and scientists to use this art fair to investigate various social distancing measures. We joined forces, and together with a lot of great people we conducted a _very_ large scale experiment into the effectiveness of face masks, buzzers, and other nudges. For the full story, read this great thread by Denny on how we went from a conceptual idea in May (see the paper explaining our idea <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/53ey9/" target="blank">here</a>), to this study with hundreds of participants in August.
